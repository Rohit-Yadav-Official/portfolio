2. **Navigate to Forms**
   - Click on "Forms" in the top navigation
   - You should see "contact" form listed

3. **Set Up Form Notifications**
   - Click on "Forms" in the sidebar
   - Click on "Form notifications"
   - Click "Add notification"
   - Select "Email notification"

4. **Configure Email**
   - **Email to notify**: Enter your email (e.g., yadavrohit-dev@outlook.com)
   - **Event to listen for**: Form submission
   - **Form**: contact
   - Click "Save"

### Step 3: Test the Form

1. Visit your website: https://yadavrohit.in
2. Scroll to the contact section
3. Fill out the form with test data
4. Click Submit
5. You should see a success message
6. Check your email inbox (and spam folder) for the notification

## 📧 What You'll Receive

When someone submits the form, you'll receive an email with:
- **From**: Netlify Forms
- **Subject**: New form submission from [your site]
- **Content**:
  - Name: [Submitted name]
  - Email: [Submitted email]
  - Message: [Submitted message]
  - Submission time
  - IP address (for spam detection)

## 🎯 How It Works

### Frontend (React)
```javascript
// When user submits:
1. Form data is collected
2. Validation checks run
3. "Sending..." state shows
4. Data sent to Netlify
5. Success/Error message displays
6. Form resets (if successful)
```

### Backend (Netlify)
```
1. Netlify receives form data
2. Spam filters check submission
3. Data stored in Netlify dashboard
4. Email notification sent to you
5. User sees success message
```

## 🛡️ Spam Protection

Built-in protection includes:
- **Honeypot field** (hidden field that bots fill)
- **reCAPTCHA** (optional, can be added)
- **Rate limiting** by Netlify
- **IP blocking** available in Netlify dashboard

## 📊 View Form Submissions

### In Netlify Dashboard:

2. Click "Forms" in the sidebar
3. Click on "contact" form
4. See all submissions with:

### Custom Success Page
Instead of the message, redirect to a thank you page:

// In contact.jsx, after successful submission:
window.location.href = "/thank-you";
```

### Slack Notifications
Get notified in Slack instead of email:

1. Netlify Dashboard → Forms → Form notifications

5. Save

### Webhook Integration
Send form data to your own server:

1. Netlify Dashboard → Forms → Form notifications
2. Select "Outgoing webhook"
3. Enter your webhook URL
4. Form data will POST to your endpoint

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
